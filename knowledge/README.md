# Knowledge Base

Use this folder as the single source of truth for solved problems and reusable delivery patterns.

## Rules

- Capture only patterns that are proven in solved work.
- Keep entries concise and reusable.
- Include tradeoffs, failure modes, and complexity.
- Link each new entry in `knowledge/INDEX.md`.

## Entry Types

- `solutions/`: concrete solved problems with context + final approach.
- `patterns/algorithms/`: reusable coding and algorithm strategies.
- `patterns/aesthetics/`: reusable visual and UX composition strategies.

## Definition Of Done For New Entry

- Problem/pattern is described in practical terms.
- Reuse conditions are explicit (when to use / when not to use).
- Complexity or implementation cost is included.
- Common mistakes are listed.
- `knowledge/INDEX.md` is updated.
