# Pattern: Visual Hierarchy Layers

- Type: Aesthetic/UI
- Status: Proven
- Tags: hierarchy, readability, conversion

## Use When

- Pages need clear scanning order and strong call-to-action.
- Content density risks visual noise.

## Visual Intent

Users should identify value proposition, supporting detail, and next action within the first viewport.

## Structure

- Hierarchy: headline -> supporting copy -> proof -> primary action.
- Spacing rhythm: use one base unit and 2x/3x multiples between layers.
- Alignment: keep primary text/action on one vertical axis.

## Color/Typography Rules

- Reserve highest contrast for headline and primary CTA.
- Keep body copy at comfortable line length and contrast.
- Use one expressive display face and one readable body face.

## Interaction/Motion Rules

- Entrance motion should reinforce reading order.
- Animate only meaningful transitions (state change, focus, action).

## Anti-Patterns

- Similar visual weight across all blocks.
- Multiple competing primary actions in one view.
